## Introduction

This project is focused on predicting road traffic accident severity using machine learning classification algorithms. The dataset used for this project was collected from the Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments and covers the years 2017-2020. It's important to note that sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding to ensure privacy.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to classify the accident severity, a multi-class variable, based on 31 other features. The evaluation metric for this classification task is the F1-score.

## Features

- 32 features
- 12,316 instances of accidents

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Streamlit for the web application
